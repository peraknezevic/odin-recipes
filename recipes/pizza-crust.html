    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.
      You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to
      go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Yeast</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Bread Flour</li>
      <li>Olive Oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until
        creamy, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You
        can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to
        make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a
        12-inch circle. Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.
      </li>
      <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove
        from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
